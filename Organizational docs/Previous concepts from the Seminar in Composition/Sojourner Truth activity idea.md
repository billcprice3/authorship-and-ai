Activity: The "Ain't I a Woman?" Problem
Authorship, Mediation, and Intentionality
This activity is a "rug pull" designed to provide a powerful, historical analogue to the modern problem of AI authorship. It forces students to grapple with a core theme: What happens to an author's "voice" and "intent" when a "mediating entity" takes control of the "performance"?
Part 1: The Inference (The Setup)
Instructions for Students:
> In this first part of the activity, we will explore the powerful connection between a text and its author.
>  * Read the attached text: "Excerpts from the 'Ain't I a Woman?' speech by Sojourner Truth (as recorded by Frances Gage in 1863)."
>  * Write your analysis (2-3 paragraphs): Based only on the text provided, what are your inferences about the author, Sojourner Truth?
>    * What do you infer about her background and education?
>    * What do you infer about her personality?
>    * What specific linguistic features (word choice, dialect, rhetorical style) in the text lead you to these conclusions?
> Goal: This is an exercise in "reading" the author behind the words.
> [Note: Students will submit this before getting access to Part 2.]

Part 2: The Rug Pull (The Reveal)
Follow-up Module / In-Class Lecture:
After students have submitted their inferences, they are given the "rug pull":
 * Fact 1: The text they read is a fabrication. It was written 12 years after the speech by a white editor, Frances Gage.
 * Fact 2: Sojourner Truth was not from the South. She was from New York, grew up speaking Dutch, and spoke English in a crisp, Northern (and non-stereotypical) accent.
 * Fact 3: The "editor" (Gage) acted as a mediating entity. She regenerated Truth's speech in a voice she and her white audience expected a formerly enslaved Black woman to have. She inserted her own biases and stereotypes into the "performance."
Part 3: The Connection (The "Big Idea")
Discussion & Synthesis:
This is where you bridge the historical example to the course theme, decoupling competence from performance.
Key Discussion Questions:
 * Your inferences in Part 1 were probably correct based on the text... but wrong about the person. Why? Who was the real "author" of the voice you read?
 * How is the editor, Frances Gage, acting like a biased algorithm?
 * How does this 19th-century problem map directly onto 21st-century "Authorship and AI"?
   * When an AI "polishes" your writing or generates text for you, it is acting as a mediating entity.
   * It is not using your "competence" or "intentionality." It is generating a "performance" based on its statistical biases (the "AI slop" voice).
   * In both cases, the "author's" true voice is lost, replaced by a fabrication that fits an external set of expectations.
