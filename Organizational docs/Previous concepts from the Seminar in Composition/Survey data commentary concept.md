## Activity: Primary Research - AI Attitudes Survey

### 🎯 Overview & Goals

This assignment is a hands-on, multi-stage project where you will design, conduct, and analyze your own primary research.

We often talk about what "people" think about AI, but this is your chance to collect *real data*. This project is a "meta" activity: you will be conducting research on the very topic of this course, allowing you to practice research skills while simultaneously "engaging with the positions of others" [Course Goal 2].

The project has three main phases:
1.  **Phase 1: Collaborative Survey Design** (Group)
2.  **Phase 2: Data Collection** (Class-wide)
3.  **Phase 3: Data Commentary** (Individual)

### Phase 1: Collaborative Survey Design (Group)

You will be split into two groups (Group A & Group B).

**Your Task:**
As a group, you will design a short survey (max 10 questions) about attitudes, beliefs, or experiences related to Generative AI.

**The Process:**
1.  **Shared Document:** Each group will get a link to a shared document.
2.  **Brainstorm & Draft:** Your group will collaboratively draft, debate, and refine your survey questions.
    * Each student must contribute at least one potential question to the discussion.
    * You must decide on a final set of 10 or fewer questions.
    * You can use a mix of question types (e.g., Likert scale, multiple choice, short answer).
3.  **Finalize:** Your group must finalize your list of questions in the shared doc by **[Date]**.

**My Role (The "Scaffold"):**
I will take your group's finalized questions from the document and build them into a professional survey tool (e.g., Qualtrics or Google Forms) for you. This way, you can focus on the *design* of the questions, not the technical setup.

### Phase 2: Data Collection

This part is simple.
* Group A will take Group B's survey.
* Group B will take Group A's survey.

I will then anonymize and compile the results from both surveys and distribute the raw data (in a simple spreadsheet) back to the entire class. You will now have a novel, primary dataset on your peers' views on AI.

### Phase 3: Data Commentary (Individual)

**Your Task:**
Write a 1-2 paragraph data commentary (approx. 250-300 words) based on the survey data collected from your *own* group's survey (i.e., the one you helped design).

This is the same genre of writing we have practiced in class. Your goal is not to *report all* the findings, but to:
1.  **Identify** one or two specific, interesting, or surprising trends in the data.
2.  **Describe** what the data shows (the "what").
3.  **Analyze** *why* the data might look that way (the "so what?").
4.  **Conclude** with a potential implication, prediction, or recommendation.

You will submit this individual data commentary by **[Date]**.
