# Activity: AI Workflow Gallery

## Purpose
AI tools are already being used in many different ways for academic writing. Some uses seem clearly acceptable, some clearly problematic, and many fall in gray areas that depend on context and intent. Before we develop our own frameworks for responsible AI use, we need to understand the range of actual practices people are employing—and think critically about what makes different approaches more or less ethically defensible.

## The Assignment
Describe 2-3 different AI workflows that someone *could* use in academic writing contexts. Whether it’s something you’ve done yourself or something you’re just imagining, use impersonal language ("A student could...", "Someone might...", "One approach would be...") to describe these workflows.

For each workflow, provide:

1. **Description**: Describe the workflow in detail
   - What AI tool is used?
   - What prompts or inputs are given?
   - How is the output used?
   - What does the human do vs. what does the AI do?

2. **Context**: What type of writing task might this workflow be used for?
   - Discussion board replies? Research papers? Brainstorming? Editing?

3. **Analysis**: What authorship questions does this workflow raise?
   - Where is the human's "competence" or "intent" in this process?
   - What would make this use more or less ethically defensible?
   - How does this relate to concepts we've discussed (mediation, competence vs. performance, etc.)?

## Format
Post your 2-3 workflow descriptions to the discussion board. After posting, read through your classmates' submissions and be prepared to discuss them in class.

## Example
> **Workflow**: A student struggling with discussion board replies might prompt ChatGPT: "Given this classmate's post about [topic], suggest 3 different directions I could take in my reply." The AI generates three response approaches (like dialogue options in a video game). The student reads all three, picks one direction that matches their actual thinking, and writes their reply—sometimes using the AI's phrasing, sometimes ignoring it entirely, sometimes just getting inspired by the direction.
> 
> **Context**: Weekly discussion board replies in an online course.
> 
> **Analysis**: This raises questions about where the "author" is in this process. The student is making the key interpretive decision (which response direction fits their intent), and doing the final writing. But they're outsourcing the "what could I say here?" brainstorming to AI. Is this different from talking through ideas with a friend? Does it matter that the student is burnt out and using AI to reduce friction in a task they find exhausting? What if this same workflow were used out of laziness rather than exhaustion—does intent matter?
