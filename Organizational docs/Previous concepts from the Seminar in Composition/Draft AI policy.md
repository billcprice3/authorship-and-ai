**AI and Authorship**

In this course, we will actively investigate and experiment with generative AI as part of our inquiry into what it means to write and think in the age of non-human, non-thinking tools that can produce plausible-looking text. You will have opportunities to explore responsible workflows and test the potential of these systems to support idea generation, research, and revision, while also analyzing the limitations and ethical implications of generative AI tools.

Because generative AI can now produce fluent text that resembles human-written compositions, traditional ideas of plagiarism and authorship have become harder to apply in the context of determining appropriate academic conduct. Therefore, in this course, our focus is on developing personal and intellectual responsibility for the work you sign your name to.

If you use AI tools in your writing process, you are expected to be prepared to be transparent about how and why you used them and to take full ownership of the results, including omissions, errors, and flaws in genre or formatting. This means you should be able to explain your workflow, evaluate the reliability of what AI produces, and revise any AI-generated material so that it genuinely represents your own thinking and your own voice. The goal is for you to remain the author; the person making all significant interpretive and ethical decisions about what enters your text. Because there is no reliable or fair way to distinguish human from machine writing, let alone to fairly judge the intent of the usage of generative AI tools, integrity in this class rests on your reflection, disclosure, and accountability- in other words, your good faith and maturity as a thinker and author- rather than on external forms of policing.

In sum, this topic is a complex and controversial site of inquiry. Working responsibly with AI requires effort, metacognition, and reflection, as well as navigating complicated and fraught cultural disagreements. Our goal is not to draw an easy “yes/no” line, but to learn together how to think critically about authorship in the age of automated text drafting technologies.
