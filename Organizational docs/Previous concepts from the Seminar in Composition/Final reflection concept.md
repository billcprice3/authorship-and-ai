# Final Reflection: Your AI Writing Practice

## Purpose
Throughout this semester, we've examined how AI tools challenge traditional notions of authorship, explored concepts like linguistic competence vs. performance, and practiced various AI-integrated workflows. This final reflection asks you to synthesize what you've learned into a personal framework for using AI in your future academic and professional writing.

## The Assignment
Write a 2-3 page reflective essay that articulates your approach to using AI tools in writing. This is not about arriving at a "correct" answer—students in this class may reach different conclusions about AI use, and that's expected. What matters is that you can articulate a coherent, thoughtful position informed by the concepts and experiences from this course.

## Possible Directions (choose your own focus)
You might address questions like:
- How have your attitudes toward AI and writing changed over the semester?
- What principles will guide your decisions about when and how to use AI?
- In what situations would you use AI? In what situations would you refuse to?
- How do you define "authorship" when AI is involved in the writing process?
- What responsibilities do you have when using AI tools in academic or professional contexts?

## Requirements
- 2-3 pages (approximately 600-900 words)
- Reference at least 2 course concepts, activities, or readings
- Articulate a coherent personal position (not just description of what we studied)
- No required structure—organize your thoughts in whatever way makes sense

## Assessment
This reflection is assessed on the depth and coherence of your thinking, not on whether you're "pro-AI" or "anti-AI." Strong reflections demonstrate:
- Engagement with course concepts
- Honest self-examination
- Thoughtful articulation of principles to guide future decisions
- Clear reasoning (even if your position is still evolving)

## A Note on AI Use in This Assignment
You decide whether to use AI tools in writing this reflection. If you do, consider whether that choice is itself worth discussing in your essay.
