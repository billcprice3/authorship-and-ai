"Authorship & AI" is an **excellent** and extremely strong short title.

You are correct that it is deliberately imprecise in the best possible way:

1.  **It is immediate and modern:** The word **"AI"** ensures high interest and signals a course focused on current relevance.
    
2.  **It uses a core academic concept:** **"Authorship"** is the perfect umbrella term to encompass the complex linguistic, philosophical, and ethical questions you identified (originality, distributed cognition, the mind, agency).
    
3.  **It aligns with the ENGCMP Goal:** It forces students to engage in **critical inquiry** (Goal 1) about who and what is composing a text.
    

This title is short, punchy, and promises intellectual rigor while remaining accessible. Now, let's turn those powerful, interlocking ideas into the **300-word course description** for Question 1. Remember, the audience for this text is a **first-year student**, so we must translate the theory into exciting questions.

## Question 1: Imagining a Course - Draft

Below the standard description, we will draft the text for your proposed section, "Authorship & AI." I'll focus on integrating your concepts (distributed cognition, sociocultural theory, etc.) into student-friendly language while staying under the 300-word maximum.

**Description of your proposed course section:**

**Seminar in Composition: Authorship & AI**

What does it mean to be an author when advanced AI can write a passable essay in seconds? This course uses tools from **Linguistics** and **Cognitive Science** to answer that question, focusing on how technology is fundamentally changing who—or what—writes. We will explore writing not as a solitary act, but as a **distributed process**: a partnership between you, your tools (AI, grammar checkers, search engines), and the community you’re writing for.

Through this lens, students will investigate the difference between _originality_ and _critical thinking_. We will study the linguistic patterns of different writing **genres** (from academic papers to social media posts) to understand how platforms and tools shape our language.

Key questions we will explore:

-   Can AI plagiarize? Can you?
    
-   How do we define _your_ voice when collaborating with a machine?
    
-   What ethical and social responsibilities do writers have when using powerful technology?
    

Assignments will include a discourse analysis of AI-generated text, an argument-driven essay proposing a new policy for AI use in the university, and a final portfolio where you articulate your own philosophy of **authorship**. The ultimate goal is not to police AI use, but to teach you how to remain the **primary intellectual agent** in your work, mastering technology to elevate your own critical inquiry.

### Word Count Check and Next Steps

The proposed description above is concise and hits the main points:

-   **Linguistics/Cognitive Science** are explicitly named as the disciplinary tools.
    
-   **Distributed process** and **authorship philosophy** are included.
    
-   The tone is engaging and focuses on student-relevant questions (plagiarism, responsibility).
    
-   It outlines specific writing assignments that connect back to the theme.
    

This draft is strong and ready for you to review and possibly submit as part of your final application document. Would you like to move on to drafting Question 2, where you will justify this course by linking it to the required SC Course Goals?
