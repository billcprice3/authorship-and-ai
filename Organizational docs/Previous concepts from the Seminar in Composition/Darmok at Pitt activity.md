## Activity: The "Darmok at Pitt" Lexicon Challenge

### 🎯 Overview & Goal

In the *Star Trek* episode "Darmok," an alien race speaks a language that is incomprehensible to the "Universal Translator." The tool can translate the *words* (the "Performance"), but it fails to translate the *meaning* (the "Intent" or "Competence").

Why? Because their language is made entirely of metaphors based on shared cultural stories. "Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra" means "two people working together against a common foe."

Our Generative AI tools have the *exact same problem*. They are masters of "Performance" (plausible text) but have zero "Competence" (no shared context, no lived experience, no *stories*).

**Your Goal:** To create a "Pitt-Darmok" lexicon—a set of phrases that are perfectly understandable to a Pitt student but would be "AI-proof" and completely baffling to an LLM.

### 📝 Your Task: Build the Lexicon

We will use a shared, collaborative document (like a Google Sheet) to build our lexicon. The document has three columns:

1.  **The "Darmok" Phrase:** The Pitt-based metaphorical phrase you invent.
2.  **The "Pitt" Meaning:** The actual, non-literal meaning or interpretation.
3.  **Example in Use:** A simple sentence showing how it's used.

### 💡 Example Entry

| The "Darmok" Phrase | The "Pitt" Meaning | Example in Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "Cathy, her beam bright." | A success; a victory; a great outcome. | "How did the test go?" "Cathy, her beam bright." |

### 📋 Instructions

1.  Navigate to our shared lexicon document: **[Link to Google Sheet/Doc]**
2.  Your task is to add **two (2)** new, original entries to the list.
3.  Your phrases must be based on shared Pitt culture, places, mascots, history, or experiences (e.g., The Cathedral, The O, Roc, specific campus locations, local sports figures, etc.).
4.  The goal is to be **non-literal**. The meaning should come from the *shared story* that Pitt students would understand, not the literal words themselves.
5.  **Do not** repeat an existing entry (though you can be inspired by one).

**Follow-up:** We will "test" our best phrases on an LLM in class to see *how* and *why* it fails to understand our "intent."
