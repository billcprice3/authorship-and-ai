**Seminar in Composition: Authorship and AI**

What does it mean for the future of writing if a machine can draft a plausible-looking composition in seconds? This section of Seminar in Composition takes a hard look into one of the most urgent controversies facing writers today: What does “authorship” even mean now? The rise of generative AI has disrupted the way writing is produced and challenged our understanding of the foundations of language, cognition, and the writing process. This course will examine emerging AI technologies and the sharp interdisciplinary debates about their nature and their usage. It will challenge you to move beyond the simple notion of “AI as a shortcut” and instead grapple with the linguistic, cognitive, and ethical complexities of outsourcing a part of your mind to a tool which lacks your voice, your perspective, and your intentionality. Linguistically, we will explore the way AI tools complicate the connection between the traditional notions of Linguistic Competence and Linguistic Performance. Cognitively, the course will frame human-AI co-writing processes using Distributed Cognition theory, mapping how knowledge and intentionality become distributed across the author and the tool. Ethically, we will treat academic integrity not as a clear and objective line, but as a critical philosophical problem of authorial accountability, personal intellectual development, and awareness of the ways in which AI tools tend to encode and amplify dominant cultural assumptions over individual and minority human perspectives. This seminar is designed to empower you to become a critical thinker prepared to grapple with the new tools and paradigms emerging around us, ensuring technology serves your intellectual and intentional agency, not the other way around.
