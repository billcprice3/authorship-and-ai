## Meta-Module (Introduction/Framework)

**Module 0: Authorship in the AI Age**

- Your SC Faculty Fellows framing
- “What does authorship mean now?”
- Overview of the OER’s philosophy
- How to use these modules

## Practical Considerations

**Modular design principles:**

- Each module = 1-3 week unit
- Can be used independently or sequenced
- Instructor notes for each module
- Student-facing + instructor-facing versions

**What makes this distinctive:**

- **Not anti-AI** (unlike many academic integrity resources)
- **Not uncritically pro-AI** (unlike many EdTech resources)
- **Pedagogically grounded** in your GPS model, process-over-product philosophy
- **Tool-agnostic where possible** (Markdown, open formats)
- **Practical and tested** (drawn from real teaching)

**OER grant appeal:**

- Addresses urgent need (AI in writing instruction)
- No good open resources exist yet in this space
- Transferable across institutions
- Fills gap between “ban AI” and “let students use AI however”

## What You Already Have vs. What Needs Development

**Substantially complete:**

- Module 1 (Writing Software Stack)
- Module 2 (Literature Mapping)
- Module 3 (Argumentative Essay)
- Module 4 (Source Integration)
- Module 9 (Cause-Effect Essay)

**Needs significant development:**

- Modules 5-8 (these are implicit in your practice but not yet explicitly written up)
- Modules 13-15 (these are theoretical frameworks you’ve articulated but need pedagogical translation)

**Could be adapted from existing materials:**

- Modules 10-12 (you have pieces of these scattered across Ling 7 and Ling 9)

The hook of “Authorship & AI” is strong, and you have enough material to make this a legitimate OER grant application. The key is framing it as addressing a critical gap: **how to teach writing responsibly in the AI era, treating AI as a tool to be used thoughtfully rather than banned or used uncritically.**


# ESL
This is a crucial insight. You’re right that your ESL background is both a strength and a potential blind spot for this OER project.

## The ESL Context Problem

**Traditional ESL rubrics assess things like:**

- Grammatical accuracy
- Vocabulary range and precision
- Sentence structure complexity
- Idiomatic language use
- L1 transfer errors

**But AI completely disrupts this:**

- Grammarly/Copilot masks grammatical errors
- AI suggests sophisticated vocabulary
- AI generates complex sentence structures
- AI eliminates L1 interference patterns
- **You can no longer reliably assess “language proficiency” through written output**

As you note, these rubrics are “increasingly obsolete” because they measure surface features that AI trivially fixes.

## What This Means for Your OER

**If you’re positioning this as “Authorship & AI”:**

You need to decide: **Is this an ESL-specific resource, or a general academic writing resource?**

### Option 1: ESL-Specific Focus

**Advantages:**

- Leverages your expertise and credentials
- Addresses a specific, underserved population
- Could focus on unique ESL+AI challenges

**Challenges:**

- Smaller potential audience
- ESL assessment is in crisis due to AI (as you’ve identified)
- Harder to get broad adoption

**What this version would include:**

- How ESL students can use AI as a language learning tool (not just a crutch)
- Distinguishing between AI for language polishing vs. AI for content generation
- Helping students develop their own voice in L2 writing despite AI temptations
- Assessment strategies for ESL contexts where AI use is expected

### Option 2: General Academic Writing Resource

**Advantages:**

- Much broader audience (all composition instructors facing AI challenges)
- Easier to get grant funding for wider-impact project
- Your insights apply regardless of L1 background

**Challenges:**

- You’d need to be careful not to over-focus on ESL concerns
- Rubrics and assessment need to work for native speakers too
- More competition in the general writing instruction space

**What this version would include:**

- Your literature mapping, argumentation scaffolding, tool stack (all work for any student)
- Assessment focused on **process and intellectual work** rather than surface correctness
- Rubrics that evaluate **authorial decision-making** and **critical thinking** rather than grammar

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Probably Best)

**Core modules work for all students, with ESL-specific extensions:**

**Main OER:**

- Authorship & AI (general)
- Writing Software Stack (general)
- Literature Mapping (general)
- Argumentative Essay scaffolding (general)
- Assessment of process/thinking (general)

**ESL-Specific Supplemental Modules:**

- Using AI for language development (not just correction)
- Balancing L2 development with AI assistance
- ESL instructor considerations
- Modified rubrics for ESL contexts

This approach maximizes your audience while still leveraging your ESL expertise as a **differentiator** rather than a **limitation**.

## What Rubrics Should Actually Assess (Post-AI)

**Instead of surface correctness, assess:**

1. **Authorial Intention & Decision-Making**

- Can the student explain why they chose this structure?
- Can they articulate their rhetorical choices?
- Do they understand their audience?

1. **Source Integration & Synthesis**

- Are sources used to support original thinking?
- Does the student synthesize across sources or just report?
- Are citations accurate and appropriate?

1. **Process Evidence**

- Did they complete scaffolding steps?
- Do their drafts show revision (not just polishing)?
- Can they reflect on their process?

1. **Critical Engagement with AI**

- If they used AI, can they explain how and why?
- Do they recognize AI limitations?
- Did they maintain agency over the argument?

1. **Intellectual Honesty**

- Is the thinking their own?
- Are they transparent about sources (including AI)?
- Can they defend their claims?

**These criteria work equally well for:**

- ESL students
- Native English speakers
- Undergrads
- Grad students

## Practical Recommendation

**For your OER grant application:**

1. **Position it as a general academic writing resource** (broader appeal, easier funding)
1. **Highlight your ESL background as expertise** that gives you unique insight into language + AI dynamics, not as limiting your audience
1. **Include ESL-specific considerations** in instructor notes or as optional extension modules
1. **Design rubrics that assess thinking and process** rather than surface correctness (works for all students, solves the ESL+AI assessment crisis)
1. **Frame the problem broadly:** “AI has disrupted writing assessment for everyone—we need new approaches that focus on intellectual work”

## Your Competitive Advantage

**You can credibly say:**

- “I’ve taught writing to both L2 and L1 students”
- “I’ve designed curricula for ESL contexts where surface correctness was traditionally prioritized”
- “AI has forced me to rethink assessment entirely—these approaches work regardless of student L1”
- “My ESL background makes me especially attuned to the ways AI can mask vs. support genuine learning”

That positions your ESL expertise as a **strength** that led you to develop more robust assessment approaches, not as a **limitation** that makes your work only relevant to ESL contexts.

**Bottom line:** Build for the general case, but bring your ESL insights to bear on the problem. The assessment crisis AI creates is universal—your ESL background just made you see it first and more clearly.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
